# Future-Ready-Project
Herbs Store
this is my final project deployed using azure static web app : https://thankful-cliff-0272d8910.2.azurestaticapps.net/

I have created a herbal product store website named Medi using html, css, scss, javascript. It will help the customer to finds the quality product in the website from a trusted distributor. There are five pages in my website which are home, about, product, client, contact us. Home page is the landing page of the website containing the logo and short description of the website. About page contains the brief details about ambition and goals of the website. Product page is the main page where customer can find the herbal products they like and the details about the product. Client page contains the client behind this project. Finally, the Contact Us page helps customer to share their experience and issues or product order.
